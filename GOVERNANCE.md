# Fortran-lang governance

This page describes the governance model used by the Fortran-lang community. The Fortran-lang community is a volunteer-based effort and relies on its contributors' motivation, free time, and hard work. Administrators, maintainers, and contributors choose to participate and may choose to leave any time for any or no reason.

## Code of Conduct

Any contribution to the Fortran-lang community must follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/fortran-lang/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Administrators

The administrators are responsible for keeping Fortran-lang operational. They have access to the following assets

- the Fortran-lang GitHub organization and can invite members, give write-access to projects, and create teams
- the Fortran-lang Discourse and can give moderator privileges as well as moderate the forum
- the fortran-lang.org domain
- the @fortranlang Twitter account (https://twitter.com/fortranlang)
- the Fortran-lang YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/Fortran%20Programming%20Language)
- the Fortran-lang mailing list (https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang)

Maintainers and contributors should contact the administrators in case any action for those assets is required.

Current administrators are

- Ondřej Čertík ([@certik](https://github.com/certik), ondrej@certik.us)
- Milan Curcic ([@milancurcic](https://github.com/milancurcic), milancurcic@hey.com)
- Sebastian Ehlert ([@awvwgk](https://github.com/awvwgk), awvwgk@disroot.org)
- Laurence Kedward ([@lkedward](https://github.com/lkedward), laurence.kedward@bristol.ac.uk)

### Decision-making process

Occasionally, decisions need to be made about Fortran-lang projects, teams,
communication, branding, funding, spending, public relations, and similar.
This section describes the decision-making process for the Fortran-lang
administrators team.

* The administrators meet periodically and on an as-needed basis to discuss any
  outstanding issues and make decisions on how to move forward. They will make
  their best effort to promptly discuss and decide via email, audio calls,
  and/or video calls.
* Whenever appropriate, the administrators will request feedback from the
  broader Fortran-lang community via GitHub and Fortran-lang Discourse. The
  administrators will make their best effort to consider all feedback received
  from the community while making a decision.
* The administrators will make their best good-faith effort to act and make
  decisions that are in the best long-term interest of the broader Fortran-lang
  community, Fortran-lang projects, and the Fortran language as a whole.
* The administrators will make their best good-faith effort to arrive to
  unanimous agreement on any major issue or decision that needs to be made.
* In the event in which the administrators, after extensive discussion, are
  unable to reach unanimous agreement but must take action to move forward, the
  administrators will vote and require 80% agreement to move on that decision.
* All administrators have equal voting power. For example, if there are five
  administrators, each has the voting power of 20%.
* The administrators commit to disclose and prevent any conflict of interest
  that may arise in the context of Fortran-lang receiving funds and allocating
  funds to sub-projects.
* The administrator team will have at least five members. If an administrator
  leaves the team for any reason, in which event the number of administrators
  would become less than five, the remaining administrators will make their
  best effort to replace the departing administrator.
* No single administrator will act on behalf of Fortran-lang without first
  discussing it with the administrators team.

## Maintainers

The maintainers are responsible for organizing the core projects of Fortran-lang, like the package manager, the standard library, and the webpage. Maintainers are responsible for

- coordinating (larger) projects and steering long-term plans
- helping new contributors to get acquainted with the project and provide guidance for their first contribution
- guiding new reviewers to provide comments and feedback for code contributions in pull requests and patches
- keeping the issue tracker and project boards organized
- making releases and determining their content

Unless specially required, all discussions and activities of the maintainers will be public and made in collaboration with the community and contributors. Private communications or decisions made by the maintainers will be summarized to the community and contributors publicly after removing personal, private, or sensitive information, that should not be posted publicly on the internet.

## Contributors

Everybody is welcome to contribute to Fortran-lang and its projects. Providing and discussing ideas as well as developing concepts and designs are integral contributions to any project. All contributors can steer and add to the long-term vision of the Fortran-lang projects.
